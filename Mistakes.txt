Some mistakes I made:

- in the sqlite console commands: make sure you type in sqlite3 .database.db to select the databases in the console if you make a mistake you can exit sqlite3 with CTRL-C or with ');'  inside the ...> shell. 

- do not put the var_dump value in quotations, it will dump it as a string.
